# Bible By Example

Bible By Example is a podcast dedicated to covering Scripture in a way that enables discussion between believers and non-believers. This is not a preachy service, but a walk through what really is and isn't in the scripture so we can have a constructive debate and not get distracted by arguing over things that aren't really there in the first place.
