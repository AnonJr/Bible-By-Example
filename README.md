# Bible By Example

Bible By Example is a podcast dedicated to covering Scripture in a way that enables discussion between believers and non-believers. This is not a preachy service, but a walk through what really is and isn't in the scripture so we can have a constructive debate and not get distracted by arguing over things that aren't really there in the first place.

The gospel of Jesus Christ is presented calmly, sanely, logically, to the average man, who is a man of sane, logical, common sense.

The site is built on top of GitHub Pages, and is based off of the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
